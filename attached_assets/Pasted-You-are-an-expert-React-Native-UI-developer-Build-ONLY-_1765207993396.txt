You are an expert React Native UI developer.

Build ONLY the FRONTEND UI (no backend, no real API integration) for a React Native (Expo) mobile app called:

“Agricultural Machinery Work Monitoring & Wage Transparency System”

The purpose of the app UI:
- Reduce disputes between Farmer, Machine Owner, and Machine Operator
- Show clear job summaries and wage calculations in a simple, transparent way

IMPORTANT:
- Focus ONLY on UI, navigation, layout, and dummy data.
- Use hardcoded mock data or simple in-memory state.
- Do NOT implement real API calls, authentication logic, or backend.
- You can fake async calls with timeouts or simple promises if needed.

====================================
1. GENERAL UI REQUIREMENTS
====================================

- Use React Native with functional components and hooks.
- Use Expo.
- Use React Navigation (stack + bottom tabs where needed).
- Beautiful, simple, and clean UI.
- Mobile-first, large touch targets, readable outdoors.
- Color theme:
  - Primary: green or blue (agri/tech feel)
  - Neutral background: light grey / off-white
- Typography: clear visual hierarchy (titles, subtitles, body).

Use any basic UI styling approach:
- StyleSheet, or
- Tailwind RN, or
- Simple UI library like React Native Paper (optional).

====================================
2. ROLES & FLOW (UI ONLY)
====================================

There are 3 roles:
- Farmer
- Machine Owner
- Machine Operator

You do NOT need real auth.
Instead, build a simple Role Selection & Mock Login UI:

Screens:
1. RoleSelectScreen
   - App logo and title.
   - Three big role buttons: "Farmer", "Owner", "Operator".
   - When user taps a role, navigate to a simple "Mock Login" or directly to that role's home screen.

2. MockLoginScreen (optional)
   - Fields: Name, Phone (no validation needed).
   - A "Continue" button that navigates to the corresponding role’s home screen.
   - Can be skipped – role selection can go directly to home.

====================================
3. OPERATOR UI SCREENS (UI ONLY)
====================================

Operator is the machine driver.

3.1 OperatorHomeScreen
- Header: "Hi, [Operator Name]" (use mock name).
- Stats section (3 small cards):
  - "Jobs Today"
  - "Completed"
  - "Pending"
- List: "Today’s Jobs"
  - Use FlatList with mock job data.
  - Each job item shows:
    - Field name (e.g., "Field A - Village X")
    - Machine name (e.g., "Tractor #1")
    - Status badge (Not Started / In Progress / Completed)
    - Estimated wage (e.g., "₹ 1200")
  - Tapping a job navigates to OperatorJobDetailScreen.
- Floating button or footer button: "View Wage Summary"

3.2 OperatorJobDetailScreen
- Show job info (mock data):
  - Job ID
  - Field name
  - Machine name
  - Farmer name
- Show a simple “Work Summary” card with static values:
  - Distance covered (e.g., 3.4 km)
  - Engine hours (e.g., 2.8 h)
  - Fuel used (e.g., 4.2 L) – optional
- Status chip: “Not Started” / “In Progress” / “Completed”
- Buttons (UI only, update local UI state):
  - Start Job
  - End Job
- When button is pressed, change status label and maybe show a Toast/snackbar: “Job started” / “Job completed”. No backend required.

3.3 OperatorWageSummaryScreen
- List of past jobs with mock data:
  - Job name, Date, Net wage, Status (Approved / Pending / Disputed)
- On tapping a job → OperatorWageDetailScreen.

3.4 OperatorWageDetailScreen
- Show:
  - Work summary: distance, hours (mock numbers)
  - Wage formula: e.g., "₹ 200 per hour × 5.0 hours"
  - Gross wage
  - Status: Approved / Pending / Disputed
- Use clear layout: cards, titles, labels, values.

====================================
4. FARMER UI SCREENS (UI ONLY)
====================================

Farmer sees work done on their fields and approves/disputes wages.

4.1 FarmerHomeScreen
- Header: "Welcome, Farmer"
- Stats cards:
  - Jobs this week
  - Total wage to pay
  - Machines used
- List: "Recent Jobs on My Fields"
  - Job item shows:
    - Field name
    - Machine name
    - Operator name
    - Date
    - Status: Awaiting Approval / Approved / Disputed
  - On tap → FarmerJobDetailScreen.

4.2 FarmerJobDetailScreen
- Top section: Job info
  - Field
  - Machine
  - Operator
  - Date
- Work Summary card (mock values):
  - Distance
  - Engine hours
  - Estimated area
- Wage Summary card:
  - Rate type: per hour / per distance (text)
  - Rate value
  - Calculated wage amount
- Two buttons:
  - "Approve Job & Wage"
  - "Raise Dispute"
- On "Approve" → show success UI change (e.g., status text = Approved, button disabled).
- On "Raise Dispute" → open a modal with:
  - Reason dropdown (distance incorrect, area incorrect, etc.) – static options
  - Text input for comments
  - “Submit” button → just close modal and change status visually to Disputed.

4.3 FarmerJobHistoryScreen
- A simple tab or button from home.
- List of all jobs with filters at top (just UI – no logic needed):
  - Filter pill buttons: "All", "Approved", "Pending", "Disputed" (no real filtering required, can be local state).
- Each job item shows field, machine, date, wage, status.

====================================
5. OWNER UI SCREENS (UI ONLY)
====================================

Owner sees machine utilization & operator wages.

5.1 OwnerHomeScreen
- Header: “Owner Dashboard”
- Stats cards:
  - Active machines
  - Jobs today
  - Total wage (week)
- Section: “My Machines”
  - FlatList of machine cards:
    - Machine name
    - Type (Tractor, Harvester)
    - Status: Active / Idle / Offline (dummy)
  - On tap → MachineDetailScreen.
- Button: “View All Jobs”

5.2 MachineDetailScreen
- Show machine info (mock):
  - Name, ID, type
- Tabs or segmented control for:
  - Jobs
  - Usage
  - Maintenance
- Jobs tab:
  - FlatList of jobs for that machine.
- Usage tab:
  - Show a simple static “chart-like” UI with bars made using View width percentages (no real charts library needed).
- Maintenance tab:
  - Next service due (e.g., “In 30 engine hours”)
  - List of past services (static list items).

5.3 OwnerJobsScreen
- List of all jobs related to the owner’s machines.
- Each job card:
  - Field, Machine, Operator
  - Status
  - Wage amount
  - Small label if farmer approved or not (e.g., "Farmer: Approved / Pending").
- Buttons or toggles can visually change "Wage Paid" state (local state only).

====================================
6. NAVIGATION STRUCTURE
====================================

Use React Navigation:

- Root Stack:
  - RoleSelectScreen
  - (Optional) MockLoginScreen
  - OperatorStack
  - FarmerStack
  - OwnerStack

Each role stack:
- OperatorStack:
  - OperatorHomeScreen
  - OperatorJobDetailScreen
  - OperatorWageSummaryScreen
  - OperatorWageDetailScreen

- FarmerStack:
  - FarmerHomeScreen
  - FarmerJobDetailScreen
  - FarmerJobHistoryScreen

- OwnerStack:
  - OwnerHomeScreen
  - MachineDetailScreen
  - OwnerJobsScreen

You may optionally use a BottomTabNavigator inside each role for:
- Home
- Jobs
- Profile

====================================
7. DATA & STATE (UI ONLY)
====================================

- Use hardcoded mock data objects/arrays for:
  - Users
  - Jobs
  - Machines
  - Wages
  - Summaries
- Store them in a simple `data.js` file or local state.
- No API calls.
- No async storage required (unless you want to simulate).

====================================
8. DESIGN & POLISH
====================================

- Use Card-like components for jobs, machines, summaries.
- Use small colored badges for statuses:
  - Green: Approved / Active
  - Yellow: Pending
  - Red: Disputed / Offline
- Use icons where meaningful (e.g., machine icon, clock, rupee symbol).
- Show loading placeholders or skeletons only visually (e.g., “Loading…” text) if you simulate any delay.

====================================
9. GOAL
====================================

Deliver a complete, navigable, React Native UI that:
- Looks consistent and professional.
- Demonstrates the full flow for all three roles with dummy data.
- Shows how dispute reduction and wage transparency would look in the final product.

Remember: NO real backend, NO real auth, NO actual API integration.
Everything can be mocked in the frontend.
